# Production Guide

Taking your DSPy.rb applications from development to production requires careful consideration of storage, monitoring, and operational concerns. This guide covers everything you need to run DSPy.rb at scale.

## Production Topics

### [Storage](./storage/)
Implement persistent storage for prompts, examples, and model outputs. Learn about caching strategies and data management.

### [Registry](./registry/)
Manage and version your modules, signatures, and optimized prompts across environments.

### [Observability](./observability/)
Monitor your LLM applications with logging, metrics, and tracing to ensure reliability and performance.

## Key Considerations

### Performance
- Implement caching at multiple levels
- Use async processing for non-critical paths
- Monitor token usage and costs

### Reliability
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implement circuit breakers for external services
- Use fallback strategies for critical paths

### Security
- Never log sensitive data or API keys
- Implement rate limiting
- Use environment-specific configurations

### Cost Management
- Monitor token usage per operation
- Implement usage quotas
- Cache expensive operations

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Logging and monitoring set up
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Caching strategy defined
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Cost monitoring enabled
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures
