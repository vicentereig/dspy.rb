# Optimization

One of DSPy.rb's most powerful features is automatic optimization. Instead of manually tweaking prompts, you can use optimizers to systematically improve your modules.

## Why Optimize?

Traditional prompt engineering is:
- Time-consuming and manual
- Inconsistent across different inputs
- Hard to maintain as requirements change

DSPy.rb optimization is:
- Automatic and data-driven
- Consistent and reproducible
- Adapts to new requirements

## Optimization Guides

### [Prompt Optimization](./prompt-optimization/)
Learn the fundamentals of how DSPy.rb optimizes prompts automatically using examples and metrics.

### [Simple Optimizer](./simple-optimizer/)
Start with BootstrapFewShot - the easiest optimizer that generates effective few-shot examples.

### [MIPROv2](./miprov2/)
State-of-the-art optimization with MIPROv2 featuring Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Processes, multiple optimization strategies, and production-grade performance.

### [GEPA (Genetic-Pareto)](./gepa/)
GEPA (Genetic-Pareto) optimization with advanced genetic algorithms for multi-objective prompt optimization.

### [Evaluation](./evaluation/)
Build metrics and evaluation frameworks to measure and improve your modules systematically.

### [Benchmarking Raw Prompts](./benchmarking-raw-prompts/)
Compare monolithic prompts against modular DSPy implementations to measure improvements in token usage, performance, and cost.

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with:
1. Understanding [Prompt Optimization](./prompt-optimization/) concepts
2. Trying the [Simple Optimizer](./simple-optimizer/) on your modules
3. Building proper [Evaluation](./evaluation/) metrics
4. Graduating to [MIPROv2](./miprov2/) for production use
5. Using [GEPA (Genetic-Pareto)](./gepa/) for advanced genetic algorithm-based optimization
