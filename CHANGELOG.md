## [Unreleased]

### Changed

#### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: ReAct action_input Type Safety

**What Changed:**
- ReAct's `action_input` field now uses discriminated union types with wrapper structs (`FinishInput` and `ToolInput`)
- This change enables OpenAI structured outputs compatibility with ReAct agents

**Migration Required:**

History entries now contain wrapped structs with `_type` discriminators:

```ruby
# Before (≤ 0.27.x):
history = [
  {
    step: 1,
    action: "add_numbers",
    action_input: {x: 42, y: 58},  # Plain hash
    observation: "100"
  }
]

# After (≥ 0.28.x):
history = [
  {
    step: 1,
    action: "add_numbers",
    action_input: {
      _type: "ToolInput",           # Discriminator field
      parameters: {x: 42, y: 58}    # Wrapped in parameters
    },
    observation: "100"
  }
]
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **OpenAI Structured Outputs**: ReAct now works with `structured_outputs: true` at the LM level
- ✅ **Better Type Safety**: Explicit wrapper types improve Sorbet type checking
- ✅ **Aligns with ADR-004**: Follows library's discriminated union pattern

**What You Need to Do:**

If you're accessing `action_input` from history entries in your code:

```ruby
# Before:
history.each do |entry|
  params = entry[:action_input]  # Was a plain hash or string
end

# After:
history.each do |entry|
  action_input = entry[:action_input]
  if action_input['_type'] == 'ToolInput'
    params = action_input['parameters']  # Extract from wrapper
  elsif action_input['_type'] == 'FinishInput'
    result = action_input['value']       # Extract from wrapper
  end
end
```

# After (0.13.0)

  - New `DSPy::ConfigurationError` exception with actionable error messages
  - Early validation in instrumentation helpers prevents cryptic nil errors
  - Error messages include examples for both global and module-level configuration
  - Comprehensive test coverage for configuration error scenarios

- **Ruby-OpenAI Gem Conflict Detection** (#29) - Warning system for gem conflicts
  - Detects when community `ruby-openai` gem is loaded alongside DSPy
  - Shows clear warning with migration guidance to official OpenAI SDK
  - Helps prevent namespace conflicts and unexpected behavior
  - Includes detection logic that distinguishes between official and community gems

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering:
  - Language model configuration errors and solutions
  - Gem conflict resolution steps

## [0.10.0] - 2025-07-20

### Added
- **Automatic Hash-to-Struct Type Conversion** (#42) - DSPy::Prediction now automatically converts LLM JSON responses to proper Ruby types
  - Enum values: String responses automatically converted to T::Enum instances
  - Nested structs: Hash responses recursively converted to T::Struct objects
  - Arrays: Elements converted based on their declared types
  - Default values: Missing fields use struct defaults
  - Discriminated unions: Smart type selection based on discriminator fields (String or T::Enum)
  - Graceful fallback: Original hash preserved if conversion fails

### Features
- **Union Type Support with T.any()** - Clean handling of multiple possible types
  - Automatic struct selection for discriminated unions
  - Support for T::Enum discriminators (recommended pattern)
  - Array elements with union types converted correctly
  - Deep nesting support (3+ levels with performance considerations)

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive "Automatic Type Conversion" section to complex types documentation
- Updated signatures documentation to highlight automatic conversion feature
- Created blog post "Union Types: The Secret to Cleaner AI Agent Workflows" demonstrating the pattern
- Established Architecture Decision Records (ADR) directory for design decisions

### Infrastructure
- Fixed GitHub Actions to generate OG images in production builds (GENERATE_OG_IMAGES=true)
- Added comprehensive edge case tests for DSPy::Prediction type conversion

### Fixed
- Unicode characters now display correctly in Example#to_s output (e.g., "÷" instead of "\u00F7")

## [0.9.1] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **ReAct Agent Input Flexibility** (#41) - Fixed bug where ReAct agents failed with non-string first inputs or array inputs
  - Removed hardcoded assumption that first input field is always a String "question"
  - ReAct now serializes all input fields as JSON and passes as `input_context` to LLM
  - Supports array inputs, non-string first inputs, and signatures with no string fields
  - Updated internal signatures to use generic `input_context` instead of specific `question` field
  - Added comprehensive integration tests for edge cases

### Added
- **Enhanced ReAct Input Handling** - ReAct agents now work with any input signature structure
  - Array inputs: `const :tasks, T::Array[Task]`
  - Non-string first inputs: `const :number, Integer`
  - Complex nested structures and arbitrary field combinations
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing ReAct agents

### Documentation
- Verified documentation already correctly showed ReAct flexibility
- No documentation updates needed - implementation now matches documented behavior

## [0.9.0] - 2025-07-11

### Breaking Changes
- **Strategy Configuration API** - Simplified strategy configuration using type-safe enums
  - Replaced complex strategy name strings with `DSPy::Strategy::Strict` and `DSPy::Strategy::Compatible` enum values
  - `DSPy::Strategy::Strict` selects provider-optimized strategies (OpenAI structured outputs, Anthropic extraction)
  - `DSPy::Strategy::Compatible` uses enhanced prompting that works with any provider
  - **BREAKING**: String strategy names like `"enhanced_prompting"` are no longer supported
  - **Migration**: Replace `config.structured_outputs.strategy = "enhanced_prompting"` with `config.structured_outputs.strategy = DSPy::Strategy::Compatible`

### Added
- **User-Friendly Strategy Categories** - Two clear strategy options instead of three internal implementations
  - Automatic fallback from Strict to Compatible when provider-specific features are unavailable
  - Type-safe enum values with Sorbet integration
  - Clearer documentation and error messages

### Documentation
- Updated all documentation to use new enum-based strategy configuration
- Improved blog post with correct version references and enum examples
- Clarified strategy selection behavior and fallback logic

## [0.8.1] - 2025-07-11

### Fixed

  - OpenAI API now correctly handles `additionalProperties` for nested arrays of primitive types
  - Re-recorded VCR cassette showing successful API response for complex nested structures
  - Restored original `tags: T::Array[String]` field in test cases
- **Test Infrastructure Improvements** - Fixed class naming conflicts in test adapters

### Added
- **Comprehensive Edge Case Testing** - Added extensive test coverage for OpenAI structured outputs
  - Deeply nested objects (5+ levels) with depth validation warnings
  - Mixed required/optional fields with `T.nilable` support
  - Arrays with varying object complexity
  - Schema depth validation and compatibility checks
