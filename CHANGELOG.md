## [0.15.7] - 2025-08-07

### Changed
- **Updated SDK Dependencies** - Updated to latest stable versions of official SDKs
  - OpenAI SDK updated from `~> 0.13.0` to `~> 0.16.0`

## [0.15.6] - 2025-08-05

### Fixed
- **Union Type Resilience Against LLM Hallucinations** (#59) - Fixed type coercion to filter extra fields not defined in structs
  - When LLMs return extra fields that aren't part of the target T::Struct, these are now automatically filtered out
  - Prevents `ArgumentError: Unrecognized properties` when LLMs confuse similar concepts or add hallucinated fields
  - Example: If LLM returns `synthesis` field for `ReflectAction` (which only has `reasoning` and `thoughts`), it's silently ignored
  - Makes DSPy.rb agents more robust to prompt changes and model variations
  - Added comprehensive test coverage and updated documentation

## [0.15.5] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed
- **Nilable Arrays with Union Types** (#56) - Fixed type conversion for nilable arrays containing union types
  - `T.nilable(T::Array[T.any(StructA, StructB)])` now properly converts array elements to struct instances
  - Previously elements remained as hashes instead of being converted to their respective types
  - Updated `needs_array_conversion?` and `convert_array_elements` to handle nilable wrapper types
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for nilable array edge cases

## [0.15.4] - 2025-08-02

### Fixed
- **Enum Coercion in Union Types** - Fixed edge case where enum fields within union types weren't properly coerced
  - Union type conversion now recursively applies type coercion to all struct fields
  - Fixes coffee shop example where `DrinkSize` enum was passed as string from LLM
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for enum fields within union types
  - Example: `T.any(MakeDrink, RefundOrder)` with `size: DrinkSize` enum field now works correctly

## [0.15.3] - 2025-08-02

### Fixed
- **Union Type Conversion in Predictors** (#54) - Fixed automatic conversion of LLM responses to union types
  - Added union type handling to `TypeCoercion` mixin used by `DSPy::Predict` and `DSPy::ChainOfThought`
  - LLM responses with `_type` discriminators are now correctly converted to appropriate struct instances
  - Enables elegant union type patterns in predictors as documented
  - Example: `T.any(SearchAction, AnswerAction)` now works correctly with predictors

  - Enhanced TokenTracker to handle both symbol and string keys defensively
  - Added comprehensive integration tests for token tracking with VCR

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `Response#usage` now returns `DSPy::LM::Usage` struct instead of Hash
  - Access token counts via `.input_tokens`, `.output_tokens`, `.total_tokens` instead of hash keys
  - Use `.to_h` method on usage struct if you need a hash representation
  - OpenAI responses return `DSPy::LM::OpenAIUsage` with additional `prompt_tokens_details` and `completion_tokens_details`

### Migration Guide
If you were directly accessing usage data:
```ruby
# Before (0.12.0)
response.usage[:input_tokens]   # or response.usage['input_tokens']
response.usage[:output_tokens]  # or response.usage['output_tokens']

# After (0.13.0)
response.usage.input_tokens
response.usage.output_tokens
response.usage.to_h  # if you need hash format
```
