Type Mismatch in 'subtasks'

Expected: T::Array[String]
Received: String (plain Ruby string)

The LLM returned a String, but your signature requires T::Array[String].

Suggestions:
• Check your signature definition for the 'subtasks' field
• Verify the LLM prompt asks for the correct data type
• Consider if your prompt needs clearer type instructions
• Check if the LLM model supports structured output for complex types
