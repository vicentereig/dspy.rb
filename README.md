**Build reliable LLM applications in idiomatic Ruby using composable, type-safe modules.**

The Ruby framework for programming with large language models. DSPy.rb brings structured LLM programming to Ruby developers. Instead of wrestling with prompt strings and parsing responses, you define typed signatures using idiomatic Ruby to compose and decompose AI Worklows and AI Agents.

**Prompts are the just Functions.** Traditional prompting is like writing code with string concatenation: it works until it doesn't. DSPy.rb brings you 
the programming approach pioneered by [dspy.ai](https://dspy.ai/): instead of crafting fragile prompts, you define modular 
signatures and let the framework handle the messy details.

DSPy.rb is an idiomatic Ruby surgical port of Stanford's [DSPy framework](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy). While implementing 
the core concepts of signatures, predictors, and optimization from the original Python library, DSPy.rb embraces Ruby 
conventions and adds Ruby-specific innovations like CodeAct agents and enhanced production instrumentation.

The result? LLM applications that actually scale and don't break when you sneeze.

## Your First DSPy Program

```ruby
# Define a signature for sentiment classification
class Classify < DSPy::Signature
  description "Classify sentiment of a given sentence."

  class Sentiment < T::Enum
    enums do
      Positive = new('positive')
      Negative = new('negative')
      Neutral = new('neutral')
    end
  end

  input do
    const :sentence, String
  end

  output do
    const :sentiment, Sentiment
    const :confidence, Float
  end
end

# Configure DSPy with your LLM
DSPy.configure do |c|
  c.lm = DSPy::LM.new('openai/gpt-4o-mini', 
                      api_key: ENV['OPENAI_API_KEY'],
                      structured_outputs: true)  # Enable OpenAI's native JSON mode
end

# Create the predictor and run inference
classify = DSPy::Predict.new(Classify)
result = classify.call(sentence: "This book was super fun to read!")

puts result.sentiment    # => #<Sentiment::Positive>  
puts result.confidence   # => 0.85
```

## Development Status

DSPy.rb is actively developed and approaching stability. The core framework is production-ready with 
comprehensive documentation, but I'm battle-testing features through the 0.x series before committing 
to a stable v1.0 API. 

Real-world usage feedback is invaluable - if you encounter issues or have suggestions, please open a GitHub issue!

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dspy'
```

Then run:

```bash
bundle install
```

#### System Dependencies for Ubuntu/Pop!_OS

If you need to compile the `numo-narray` dependency from source (used for numerical computing in Bayesian optimization), install these system packages:

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Ruby development files (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get install ruby-full ruby-dev

# Install essential build tools
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# Install BLAS and LAPACK libraries (required for numo-narray)
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev

# Install additional development libraries
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev
```

**Note**: The `numo-narray` gem typically compiles quickly (1-2 minutes). Pre-built binaries are available for most platforms, so compilation is only needed if a pre-built binary isn't available for your system.

## Roadmap - Production Battle-Testing Toward v1.0

DSPy.rb has transitioned from **feature building** to **production validation**. The core framework is
feature-complete and stable - now I'm focusing on real-world usage patterns, performance optimization, 
and ecosystem integration.

**Current Focus Areas:**

### Production Readiness
- ðŸš§ **Production Patterns** - Real-world usage validation and performance optimization
- ðŸš§ **Ruby Ecosystem Integration** - Rails integration, Sidekiq compatibility, deployment patterns
- ðŸš§ **Scale Testing** - High-volume usage, memory management, connection pooling
- ðŸš§ **Error Recovery** - Robust failure handling patterns for production environments

### Ecosystem Expansion  
- ðŸš§ **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Integration with MCP ecosystem
- ðŸš§ **Additional Provider Support** - Azure OpenAI, local models beyond Ollama
- ðŸš§ **Tool Ecosystem** - Expanded tool integrations for ReAct agents

### Community & Adoption
- ðŸš§ **Community Examples** - Real-world applications and case studies
- ðŸš§ **Contributor Experience** - Making it easier to contribute and extend
- ðŸš§ **Performance Benchmarks** - Comparative analysis vs other frameworks

**v1.0 Philosophy:** 
v1.0 will be released after extensive production battle-testing, not after checking off features. 
The API is already stable - v1.0 represents confidence in production reliability backed by real-world validation.
